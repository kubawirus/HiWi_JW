"""
An idea on how to solve the variable flow rate problem:
1) Create data structures to store each individual reactor state. 
2) After each reactor (n_step) store the new reactor state and the new mass flow at the end.
3) The gas thermodynamics and mass flow of each subsequent reactor 
    will be defined by the previous state stored in the corresponding structure.
4) Simulation.
5) Removal of the compound. Calculation of a new mass flow based on the previous one.
6) The new iteration may overwrite the previous one. (Maybe??). 
7) Create mass flow graphs through the reactor network.

Problems: 
8) Link mass flow to reactor pressure!!! It seems that the pressure is held constant in the reactor. 
 -> Pressure should remain const.
9) What should be constant, mass flow or e.g. volume flow, i.e. velocity only?!(Key!!!)
 -> mass flow rate is also const.
10) Compare the two simulation methods without deposition. 
11) Write the deposition in such a way that successive elements are removed "additively".-> Done
12) How to calculate density with deposition? !!!!!!!! -> deprecated
13) Create a dict that records and ideally adds deposits from each reactor -> Done
14) Check which heaviest elements can be deposited in gri30 to make it faster than in mech_13 -> Done (Only ~ 40 g/mol)
15) Plot deposition through the length of reactor
